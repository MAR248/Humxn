    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>HUMXN was born in Florida, both parents are immigrants, mom is from Cuba, and Father is Haitian. A child of two young lovers who came to the united states for opportunity and worked in the service industry where they met each other. The young artist is a third generation artist that grew up with art daily. His grandfather bequith the knowledge of anatomy, technology and sciences. Father introduced him to the advant-garde: Cubism, Surrealism, and unconventional thought process. He accompanied his dad on many of his show cultivating an awareness of the ins-and-outs of the art world. He grew up thinking outside the box. After graduating high school art magnet he met a world class builder and muralist, BlackBrain, who promptly put him to work and took him under apprenticeship. Pursued higher education in art at the New World School of the Arts in Miami. After a year and half, dropped out after the passing of his Grandfather. Funds were short and enthusiasm gassed. With the support of his family and the connection with his mentor, BlackBrain, he was able to pursue art  privately. Did many murals on his own and with the BlackBrain he solidified a youthful muse, HUMXN, where he seeks the humanity in purpose and pain. He developed the Helix Tree, The melted smiles, and the Emarald man. Launched his first solo show in December. the idea of using human resources as the way we use natural resources.</p>
